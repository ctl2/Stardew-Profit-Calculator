# Stardew Profit Calculator

A tool for calculating crop productivity in Stardew Valley.

Before you can use this tool, you must provide it with some Stardew Valley data.
This data isn't related to you or your specific copy of the game.
I am not able to include the data in the tool's distribution because of Copyright laws.
This game data is stored in XNB files within your Stardew Valley data directory. e.g. `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Stardew Valley/Content/Data`

You must:
1. Find the required files.
    `Artisan.xnb`
    `Crops.xnb`
    `ObjectInformation.xnb`
2. Convert them to JSON format.
    See `https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Editing_XNB_files#Unpack_game_files` for instructions on converting files from XNB to JSON format.
3. Place the new JSON files in the Data directory so that the tool can find them.
